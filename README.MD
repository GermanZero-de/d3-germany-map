# [wip] Germany Map

TODO Live Demo

To run this locally you have to run some local server eg. with python `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`.
The magic is happening in `map.js`.

[more details how to do that here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server)


Next TODOs:
- improve map positioning
- redraw map on resize
- colorize counties / districts by data
- zoom in functionality
- integrate berlin districts data into counties data?
