# [wip] Germany Map

## [Live DEMO](https://d3-map-testing.netlify.app/)

To run this locally you have to run some local server eg. with python `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`.
[more details how to do that here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server)


## TODOs:
- improve map positioning
- redraw map on resize
- colorize counties / districts by data
- zoom in functionality
- integrate berlin districts data into counties data?
- add some webpack stuff for old browser compability
