# [wip] Germany Map

### [Live Demo](https://d3-map-testing.netlify.app/)

To run this locally you have to run some local server eg. with python `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`.
[More details on how to do that here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server)


## Next TODOs:

- colorize counties / districts by data
- zoom in functionality (Started on this for Berlin)
- separate counties data by state
- add some webpack stuff for old browser compability
